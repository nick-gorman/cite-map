The system is based on commercially available technologies: concentrating solar thermal (CST) power with thermal storage, wind, photovoltaic (PV), existing hydro and biofuelled gas turbines. Hourly solar and wind generation data are derived from satellite observations, weather stations, and actual wind farm outputs. Together CST and PV contribute about half of total annual electrical energy supply. A range of 100% renewable energy systems for the NEM are found to be technically feasible and meet the NEM reliability standard. The principal challenge is meeting peak demand on winter evenings following overcast days when CST storage is partially charged and sometimes wind speeds are low. The model handles these circumstances by combinations of an increased number of gas turbines and reductions in winter peak demand. There is no need for conventional base-load power plants. The important parameter is the reliability of the whole supply-demand system, not the reliability of particular types of power plants.","2012-06-01","2018-07-24 03:19:22","2018-07-24 03:19:22","2018-07-24 03:19:22","606-613","","","45","","Energy Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\user\Zotero\storage\8TB96TPU\Elliston et al. - 2012 - Simulations of scenarios with 100% renewable elect.pdf; C:\Users\user\Zotero\storage\SHT64TI3\S0301421512002169.html","","","100 per cent scenarios; Base-load; Renewable electricity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is evident from this paper that there is no energy tool that addresses all issues related to integrating renewable energy, but instead the ‘ideal’ energy tool is highly dependent on the specific objectives that must be fulfilled. The typical applications for the 37 tools reviewed (from analysing single-building systems to national energy-systems), combined with numerous other factors such as the energy-sectors considered, technologies accounted for, time parameters used, tool availability, and previous studies, will alter the perception of the ‘ideal’ energy tool.

To this end we compare the projected costs in 2030 of one medium-carbon and two low-carbon fossil fuel scenarios for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) against the costs of a previously published scenario for 100% renewable electricity in 2030. The three new fossil fuel scenarios, based on the least cost mix of baseload and peak load power stations in 2010, are: (i) a medium-carbon scenario utilising only gas-fired combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) and open cycle gas turbines (OCGTs); (ii) coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) plus peak load OCGT; and (iii) gas-fired CCGT with CCS plus peak load OCGT. We perform sensitivity analyses of the results to future carbon prices, gas prices, and CO2 transportation and storage costs which appear likely to be high in most of Australia. We find that only under a few, and seemingly unlikely, combinations of costs can any of the fossil fuel scenarios compete economically with 100% renewable electricity in a carbon constrained world. Our findings suggest that policies pursuing very high penetrations of renewable electricity based on commercially available technology offer a cost effective and low risk way to dramatically cut emissions in the electricity sector.","2014-06-01","2018-07-24 03:23:25","2018-07-24 03:23:25","2018-07-24 03:23:25","196-204","","","66","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\user\Zotero\storage\JIP3MNVP\Elliston et al. - 2014 - Comparing least cost scenarios for 100% renewable .pdf; C:\Users\user\Zotero\storage\9BTMRCTG\S0960148113006745.html","","","100 percent Renewables; Carbon capture and storage; Low carbon scenarios","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These models allow participants to share energy between separately owned and operated DERs, however are largely untested. While embedded networks have generally been established for specific circumstances such as shopping centres and airports, there is growing interest in their wider application in providing a framework for local sharing of energy resources. However, the potential operational and commercial implications for key stakeholders (including consumers, network operators and retailers) are not well understood.

But electricity networks are subject to constant shocks to the available generation, load, or transmission assets. The response to these shocks is through a variety of ad hoc mechanisms which do not involve an optimisation process and therefore cannot achieve economically efﬁcient utilisation of the available assets. But the higher the cost of responding to contingencies ex post the greater the need there is to distort the ex ante operation of the power system. In cases where the power system cannot respond at all to a particular contingency ex post, the power system must often be operated ex ante as though the contingency has already happened. This signiﬁcantly reduces the efﬁciency with which the available assets can be utilised ex ante. In this paper the concept of short-run economic dispatch is introduced and mathematically modelled. The concept of short-run economic dispatch is formulated through three stages: (1) the initial steadystate equilibrium, (2) transition to a new steady-state equilibrium, and (3) ﬁnal steady-state equilibrium. These three stages model the state of power system before, during, and after contingency occurred. The derived mathematical model is a linear programming problem. The approach is illustrated using the IEEE 24-node example system.","2014-06","2018-07-26 00:56:56","2018-07-26 00:56:56","2018-07-26 00:56:56","9-18","","","58","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\user\Zotero\storage\TFUPCMCG\Hesamzadeh et al. - 2014 - Short-run economic dispatch with mathematical mode.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the key assumptions underlying this vision is that it will be possible to manage the trading of electricity between homes and micro-grids while coping with the inherent real-time dynamism in electricity demand and supply. The management of these trades needs to take into account the fact that most, if not all, of the actors in the system are self-interested and transmission line capacities are constrained. Against this background, we develop and evaluate a novel marketbased mechanism and novel trading strategies for the Smart Grid. Our mechanism is based on the Continuous Double Auction (CDA) and automatically manages the congestion within the system by pricing the ﬂow of electricity. We also introduce mechanisms to ensure the system can cope with unforseen demand or increased supply capacity in real time. Finally, we develop new strategies that we show achieve high market efﬁciency (typically over 90%).","","2018-07-26 01:09:35","2018-07-26 01:09:35","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\user\Zotero\storage\9G7ILDR2\Vytelingum et al. - Trading agents for the smart electricity grid.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One minute resolution wind and demand data was used in conjunction with a system frequency model and a market dispatch model. In the National Electricity Market (NEM) the Regulation requirement was found to increase by around 10% of the added wind capacity. However, in the much smaller South-West Interconnected System (SWIS), the Load Following requirement was found to increase by around 30-40% of the added wind capacity. FCAS (Regulation + Slow Contingency) costs are projected to increase substantially in response, increasing by a factor of 20 in the NEM, and a factor of 11 in the SWIS. While these settlements remain small by comparison with energy settlements, if these cost increases are allocated to wind generators they could be prohibitively large, being $6-8 /MWh in the NEM, and $30-60 /MWh in the SWIS.","","2018-07-26 23:32:58","2018-07-26 23:32:58","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\user\Zotero\storage\W249QR8U\Riesz et al. - Frequency Control Ancillary Service Requirements w.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is used as a case study. The most significant driver of variations in solar revenues from year to year and region to region is found to be pool prices (more than variations in solar resource). Peak pool prices (8am-6pm) are found to be a good indicator of solar revenues on a $/MWh basis. Generation during summer periods is particularly important, with a significant proportion of annual solar revenues being earned during a small number of high priced summer events. Based upon forecast pool prices, the regions Queensland and New South Wales are predicted to be optimal regions for solar development, but it is emphasised that pool price forecasts depend upon a wide range of input assumptions with high uncertainty. Finally, time of day correlations suggest that solar generators should be able to achieve significantly higher revenues than wind generators on a $/MWh basis, which should lead to higher valued Power Purchase Agreements for solar generators.","","2018-07-27 00:04:00","2018-07-27 00:04:00","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\user\Zotero\storage\VCH7LVXZ\Riesz et al. - Impacts of Electricity Markets on Solar Revenues –.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This shift towards the the use of electricity shifts the point source emissions to one which has a lower emissions intensity. Changes in load behaviour as a result of the consumer uptake of these vehicles will have signiﬁcant consequences for network and central planners for the future of Australia’s electricity supply industry. This paper investigates the effects on the security of supply of energy during these previously unseen demand patterns, while also examining changes to spot market prices and changes in emissions rates. The simulation results indicate that wholesale prices during the off-peak period will increase slowly over time with controlled charging. While uncontrolled charging increases the incidence of extreme price events and a considerable number of hours with un-served energy within the network. This increase in spot prices will require further review by policy makers of regulated retail electricity tariffs. We also discuss the implementation of possible changes to the retail tariff structure to accommodate the charging of these vehicles.","2010-09","2018-07-27 00:35:59","2018-07-27 00:35:59","2018-07-27 00:35:59","165-170","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\user\Zotero\storage\V63XGMWQ\Wagner and Reedman - 2010 - Modeling the deployment of plug-in hybrid and elec.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
